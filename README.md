Forgearoo
==============

Hi this is a terrible misguided attempt at porting masa's excellent Tweakeroo to Forge, since I like Forge and its bits and bobs, and I don't like LiteLoader and its bits and bobs.

Currently it does nothing and errors everywhere when you try to build it.

For more information and the downloads (compiled builds), go fuck yourself! For now.

Compiling
=========
* Clone the repository
* Open a command prompt/terminal to the repository directory
* run 'gradlew build'
* Have it error on you
* Cry
